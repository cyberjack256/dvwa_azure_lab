# dvwa_azure_lab

This project contains a proof-of-concept (POC) examining defensive logs within a SIEM generated by a coordinated penetration testing scoped around OWASP top 10. Using both the Damn Vulnerable Web Application (DVWA) and a penetration testing endpoing, we are able to emulate malicious traffic originating from a threat, external to the internal network resources.
